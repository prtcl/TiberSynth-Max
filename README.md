# TiberSynth

TiberSynth (v3) build with Max, node, and Lemur. Because sometimes you just need a really complicated FM tone. With vector controls. ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/prtcl/TiberSynth-Max.git
cd ./TiberSynth-Max
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then use Lemur Editor to transfer `lemur/TiberSynth.jzml` to your iPad.

Enjoy.
